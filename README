NAME
    RT::Extension::PriorityAsString - show priorities in RT as strings
    instead of numbers

SYNOPSIS
        # in RT config
        Set(@Plugins, qw(... RT::Extension::PriorityAsString ...));

        # Specify a mapping between priority strings and the internal
        # numeric representation
        Set(%PriorityAsString, (Low => 0, Medium => 50, High => 100));

        # Fine-tuned control of the order of priorities as displayed in the
        # drop-down box; usually this computed automatically and need not be
        # set explicitly.  It can be used to limit the set of options
        # presented during update, but allow a richer set of levels when
        # they are adjusted automatically.
        # Set(@PriorityAsStringOrder, qw(Low Medium High));

        # Uncomment if you want to apply different configurations to
        # different queues.  Each key is the name of a different queue;
        # queues which do not appear in this configuration will use RT's
        # default numeric scale.
        # This option means that %PriorityAsString and
        # @PriorityAsStringOrder are ignored (no global override, you must
        # specify a set of priorities per queue). You can safely leave them
        # out of your RT_SiteConfig.pm to avoid confusion.
        # Set(%PriorityAsStringQueues,
        #    General => { Low => 0, Medium => 50, High => 100 },
        #    Binary  => { Low => 0, High => 10 },
        # );
